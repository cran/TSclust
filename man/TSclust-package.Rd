\title{
Package for Time Series Clustering.
}

\description{
This package contains several measures of dissimilarity between time series, some examples of time series datasets, specific clustering algorithms, and dimension reduction algorithms.
dissimilarities begin with diss.*, and a wrapper function \code{diss} is available. Cluster evaluation methods include \code{cluster.evaluation} and \code{loo1nn.cv}. A clustering algorithm based on pairwise p-values is implemented in \code{pvalues.clust}. The package should be used along with other existing clustering packages and function such as \code{hclust}, packages \code{cluster}, ...

#the available dissimilarities can be found in the diss help, page (?diss)
#and their individual pages from there.

### The most common use case begins with a set of time series we want to cluster.
### This package includes several example datasets.
### 
data(interest.rates)
###transformation of the interest rates
trans.inter.rates <- log(interest.rates[2:215,]) - log(interest.rates[1:214,])

##use the dist function of the proxy package to easily create the dist object
#applying ACF with geometric decaying to each pair of time series
tsdist <- diss( t(trans.inter.rates) , "ACF", p=0.05)

names(tsdist) <- colnames(interest.rates)

#perform hierachical clustering to the dist object
hc <- hclust(tsdist)

#show the results
plot(hc)

mahdist <- diss( t(trans.inter.rates) , "AR.MAH", p=0.05)$p_value

pvalues.clust(mahdist, 0.05)
