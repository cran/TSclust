\title{
Clustering Algorithm Based on p-values.%%  ~~function to do ... ~~
}
\description{
Clustering algorithm based on p-values. Each group in the cluster solution is formed by
series with associated p-values greater than a pre-specified level of significance.
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~
}
\usage{
pvalues.clust(pvalues, significance)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{pvalues}{
  A \code{dist} object containing the p-values from testing the equality of each pair of time series under study.
%%     ~~Describe \code{x} here~~
}
  \item{significance}{
  The significance level.
%%     ~~Describe \code{y} here~~
}

}
\details{
Each element (i,j) in \code{pvalues} corresponds to the p-value obtained from checking whether or not the \eqn{i}-th and \eqn{j}-th series come from the same generating
model. The clustering algorithm will only group together those series whose associated p-values are greater than the pre-specified significance level. The algorithm was originally developed for its use with the p-values obtained with in \code{diss.AR.MAH} (see Maharaj, 2000), but it can be applied to any similar test.
}
\value{
 An integer vector of length n, the number of observations, giving for each observation the number (id) of the cluster to which it belongs.

## Create three sample time series
x <- cumsum(rnorm(100))
y <- cumsum(rnorm(100))
z <- sin(seq(0, pi, length.out=100))
##

## Compute the distance and check for coherent results
dd <- diss( rbind(x,y,z), "AR.MAH")
pvalues.clust( dd$p_value, 0.05 )
