\details{
The dissimilarity between two series \code{x} and \code{y} is measured in terms of the vaue of a test statistic to check the equality of their log-spectra, \eqn{m_X(\lambda)} and \eqn{m_Y(\lambda)} respectivelty. The test statistic is constructed by using the generalized likelihood ratio test criterion (Fan and Zhang, 2004). Specifically, the test statistic takes the form:
\deqn{ d(x,y) = \sum_{k=1}^T [ Z_k - \hat{\mu}( \lambda_k) - 2 \log( 1 + e^{ \{ Z_k - \hat{\mu}(\lambda_k)\}})] - \sum_{k=1}^T[Z_k - 2 \log(1 + e^{Z_k})],}{ d(x,y) = \sum[Z_k - hat\mu(\lambda_k) - 2 \log( 1 + exp(Z_k - hat\mu(\lambda_k))] - \sum[ Z_k -2 \log(1+ exp(Z_k))] | k=1 to T,}

where \eqn{I_x(\lambda_k)} and \eqn{I_y(\lambda_k)} are the periodograms of \code{x} and \code{y}, \eqn{ Z_k = \log(I_x(\lambda_k)) - \log( I_y(\lambda_k))}, and \eqn{\hat{\mu}(\lambda_k)}{hat\mu(\lambda_k)} is the local maximum log-likelihood estimator of \eqn{\mu(\lambda_k)= m_x(\lambda_k) - m_y(\lambda_k)} computed by local linear fitting.
