Normalized Compression Distance
}
\description{
Computes the distance based on the sizes of the compressed time series.
}
\usage{
diss.NCD(x, y, type = "min")

}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
    Numeric vector containing the first of the two time series.
%%     ~~Describe \code{x} here~~
}
  \item{y}{
    Numeric vector containing the second of the two time series.
%%     ~~Describe \code{y} here~~
}
 \item{type}{
 Character string, the type of compression.  May be abbreviated to a single letter, defaults to the first of the alternatives.
 }

\details{

The compression based  dissimilarity is calculated: \deqn{ d(x,y) = C(xy) - max(C(x),C(y))/ min(C(x),C(y)) } where \eqn{C(x)}, \eqn{C(y)} are the sizes in bytes of the compressed series \eqn{x} and \eqn{y}.
\eqn{C(xy)} is the size in bytes of the series \eqn{x} and \eqn{y} concatenated. The algorithm used for compressing the series is chosen with \code{type}.
\code{type} can be "gzip", "bzip2" or "xz", see \code{\link{memCompress}}. "min" selects the best separately for \code{x}, \code{y} and the concatenation.
Since the compression methods are character-based, a symbolic representation can be used, see details for an example using SAX as the symbolic representation.
The series are transformed to a text representation prior to compression using \code{as.character}, so small numeric differences may produce significantly different text representations.
While this dissimilarity is asymptotically symmetric, for short series the differences between \code{diss.NCD(x,y)} and \code{diss.NCD(y,x)} may be noticeable.
