\title{
Complexity-Invariant Distance Measure For Time Series
}
\description{
Computes the distance based on the Euclidean distance corrected by the complexity estimation of the series.
}
\usage{
diss.CID(x, y)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
    Numeric vector containing the first of the two time series.
%%     ~~Describe \code{x} here~~
}
  \item{y}{
    Numeric vector containing the second of the two time series.
%%     ~~Describe \code{y} here~~
}

}
\details{
	This distance is defined \deqn{CID(x,y) = ED(x,y) \times CF(x,y)} where \eqn{CF(x,y)} is a complexity correction factor defined as: \deqn{ max(CE(x), CE(y)) / min(CE(x), CE(y)) } and \eqn{CE(x)} is a compexity estimate of a time series \eqn{x}. \code{diss.CID} therefore increases the distance between series with different complexities. If the series have the same complexity estimate, the distance defenerates Euclidean distance. The complexity is defined in \code{diss.CID} as:
		 \deqn{ CE(x) = \sqrt{ \sum_{t=1} (x_{t+1} - x_t)^2  } }{CE(x) = sqrt( sum ( diff(x)^2 ) )}
}
\value{
The computed dissimilarity.
