\title{
Clustering Evaluation Index Based on Leave-one-out One-nearest-neighbor Evaluation
}
\description{
 Computes the leave-one-out one-nearest-neighbor cross-validation of an arbitrary distance matrix.
}
\usage{
loo1nn.cv(d, G)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
\item{d}{
    A \code{dist} object.
}
  \item{G}{
    Integer vector with the labels of the true cluster solution. Each element of the vector specifies the cluster 'id' that the element belongs to.
}
}
\details{
    Computes the proportion of succesful clusters that the given distance matrix produces using leave-one-out one-nearest-neighbor cross-validation. Distance ties are solved by majority vote. A tie while voting produces a warning and is solved by selecting a candidate cluster at random. 
}
\value{
The computed proportion.
