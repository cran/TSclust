\title{
Dissimilarity Based on the Integrated Squared Difference between the Log-Spectra%%  ~~function to do ... ~~
}
\description{
Computes the dissimilarity between two time series in terms of the integrated squared difference between non-parametric estimators of their log-spectra.
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~
}
\usage{
diss.SPEC.ISD(x, y, plot=FALSE, n=length(x))
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
    Numeric vector containing the first of the two time series.
%%     ~~Describe \code{x} here~~
}
  \item{y}{
    Numeric vector containing the second of the two time series.
%%     ~~Describe \code{y} here~~
}
	\item{plot}{
		If \code{TRUE}, plot the smoothed spectral densities of the two series.
}
\item{n}{
	The number of points to use for the linear interpolation. A value of n=0 uses numerical integration instead of linear interpolation. See details.
}

\details{

\deqn{ d(x,y) = \int ( \hat{m}_x(\lambda) - \hat{m}_y(\lambda))^2 \, d\lambda, }{ d(x,y) = INT( (m_x(\lambda) - m_y(\lambda))^2 )d\lambda }
where \eqn{ \hat{m}_x(\lambda) }{m_x(\lambda)} and \eqn{ \hat{m}_y(\lambda) }{m_y(\lambda)} are local linear smoothers of the log-periodograms, obtained using the maximum local likelihood criterion.

By default, for performance reasons, the spectral densities are estimated using linear interpolation using \code{n} points. If \code{n} is 0, no linear interpolation is performed, and \code{integrate} is used to calculate the integral, using as many points as \code{integrate} sees fit.
