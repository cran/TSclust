Description: This package contains a set of measures of dissimilarity
        between time series to perform time series clustering. Metrics
        based on raw data, on generating models and on the forecast
        behavior are implemented. Some additional utilities related to
        time series clustering are also provided, such as clustering
        algorithms and cluster evaluation metrics.
